## How ARM Rating Works

The ARM rating system evaluates skeeball performance based on 5-game sessions:

- **Scoring**: Each game scored 0-900 points (increments of 10)
- **Session Total**: Maximum 4500 points across 5 games
- **Rating Range**: 7.0 (beginner) to 25.0+ (elite)
- **Calculation**: Performance compared to expected score for current rating

### Rating Levels
- **7.0-9.9**: Beginner Player
- **10.0-11.9**: Developing Player  
- **12.0-14.9**: Intermediate Player
- **15.0-17.9**: Advanced Player
